      <p>"I didn't realize what I wanted to be when I grew up until my late 20's and in
        the middle of my 7 year career as an active duty sailor. I wanted to learn a skill
        that was technologically based but also quenched my yearning to be creative and artistic,
        and programming really hit the sweet spot for me. Learning about coding basics, agile, 
        google fu, and applying it to my everyday life makes me wonder what I ever did without 
        it. I'm done with dreaming and ready to start doing, and another bootcamp sounds right up my alley."
